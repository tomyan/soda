Soda JavaScript Loader
======================

Version 0.3

Description
-----------

Implements a simple asyncronous loader and module pattern based on dynamic
script tags.

Usage
-----

In your html file:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="soda_compressed.js"></script>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        
        // tell Soda where to find modules that start mylib
        soda.lib('../mylib/src', 'mylib');
        
        // tell Soda where to find all other modules
        soda.lib('http://my.js.repo/js');
        
        // load mylib and mylib_blah
        soda.load(
            ['mylib', 'mylib_blah'],
            function (mylib, mylib_blah) {
                // ../mylib/src/mylib.js and ../mylib/src/mylib/blah.js are loaded here
            }
        );
        
        // don't assume they are loaded here - the loader is async
        
    </script>

In your module (Soda module pattern):

    soda.module({
        name    : 'mylib',        // this must match the name used to load it
        depends : ['myotherlib'], // dependencies are automatically loaded
        code    : function (myotherlib) {
            // dependencies are available here via parameters
        }
    });

### Using with Node.js

Soda works with Node.js. Use Node's `require` method to load soda (use the uncompressed
version) as you would any Node module. You can then load and depend on modules as you
would on the client-side. Additionally, depending on modules with the prefix `node:`
allows you to load node's built in modules and those located in Node's `require.paths` array:

    soda.load('node:sys', function (sys) {
        sys.puts('hello');
    });

This allows Soda to be the only module you need to load synchronously and `soda` to be the only
global variable that isn't sandboxed by Soda's module system.

This mechanism is likely to be extended in the future to allow alternative modules for different
environments (e.g. 'node:http|browser:http_over_comet').

API
---

### Function: soda.lib

Tell Soda where to load modules within a particular namespace from.

Arguments:
  urlPrefix       - (string) prefix of the URL to load modules from.
  namespacePrefix - (string/strings) optional prefix(es) of namespaces to load.

### Function: soda.load

Load a module/modules and run a function when done.

Arguments:
  module - (string/array of strings) module(s) to load.
  onload - (function, optional) callback to run when the module(/modules) is loaded.

### Function: soda.module

Create a new module with the Soda module pattern.

Arguments:
  opts - (object) options object containing:
    name    - (string, required) the module name (must correspond to the filename).
    depends - (array of strings, optional) the modules that this module depends on.
    code    - (function, required) called when the dependencies are loaded, with the
              namespace of each dependency passed as a paramter. The function should
              return a namespace object containing the public interface of the module.

Building
--------

To build a compressed version of Soda from a checked out copy, run `make` in the root
directory. The file `src/soda_compressed.js` is created.

Installation
------------

Download [soda_compressed.js](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/tomyan/soda/soda_compressed.js)
and save to a convenient location.
